                        HP's History
                    </h2>
                    <p>The Hewlett-Packard Company (commonly referred to as HP, and stylized as hp), or Hewlett-Packard
                        (/ˈhjuːlɪt ˈpækərd/ HEW-lit PAK-ərd), was an American multinational information technology
                        company headquartered in Palo Alto, California. It developed and provided a wide variety of
                        hardware components as well as software and related services to consumers, small- and
                        medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and large enterprises, including customers in the government,
                        health and education sectors. In 1999, HP split into two companies: one retaining the original
                        company name, the other named Agilent Technologies. The first product line of Hewlett-Packard,
                        test and measurement equipment, went to Agilent Technologies, while HP retained focus on its
                        later products including computers and printers. In 2015, HP again was split into two separate
                        companies, HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.

                                    The company was founded in a one-car garage (the historic HP Garage at 367 Addison
                                    Avenue, an official California Historical Landmark; its plaque reads "Birthplace of
                                    'Silicon Valley'") in Palo Alto, California by Bill Hewlett and David Packard, and
                                    initially produced a line of electronic test and measurement equipment. The company
                                    got its first big contract in 1938, providing its test and measurement instruments
                                    for production of Walt Disney Pictures' hugely successful animated film Fantasia.
                                    This success led Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to formally establish their
                                    Hewlett-Packard Company on 1 January 1939. The company grew into a multinational
                                    corporation widely respected for its products, and its management style and culture
                                    known as the HP Way which was adopted by other businesses worldwide. HP was the
                                    world's leading PC manufacturer from 2007 to Q2 2013, at which time Lenovo ranked
                                    ahead of HP.[1][2][3] HP specialized in developing and manufacturing computing, data
                                    storage, and networking hardware, designing software and delivering services. Major
                                    product lines included personal computing devices, enterprise and industry standard
                                    servers, related storage devices, networking products, software and a diverse range
                                    of printers and other imaging products. HP directly marketed its products to
                                    households, small- to medium-sized businesses and enterprises as well as via online
                                    distribution, consumer-electronics and office-supply retailers, software partners
                                    and major technology vendors. HP also had services and a consulting business for its
                                    products and partner products.

                                    Hewlett-Packard Company history included the spin-off of its electronic and
                                    bio-analytical test and measurement instruments business as Agilent Technologies in
                                    1999 (test and measurement instruments were the first products of the company, which
                                    were used in production of Disney's 1939 animated film Fantasia); its merger with
                                    Compaq in 2002, and the acquisition of EDS in 2008, which led to combined revenues
                                    of $118.4 billion in 2008 and a Fortune 500 ranking of 9 in 2009. In November 2009,
                                    HP announced the acquisition of 3Com,[4] with the deal closing on April 12, 2010.[5]
                                    On April 28, 2010, HP announced the buyout of Palm, Inc. for $1.2 billion.[6] On
                                    September 2, 2010, HP won its bidding war for 3PAR with a $33 a share offer ($2.07
                                    billion), which Dell declined to match.[7]

                                    Hewlett-Packard spun off its enterprise products and services business as Hewlett
                                    Packard Enterprise on November 1, 2015. Hewlett-Packard held onto the PC and printer
                                    businesses, and was renamed to HP Inc.[8]

                                    HP is recognized as the symbolic founder of Silicon Valley, although it did not
                                    actively investigate semiconductor devices until a few years after the "traitorous
                                    eight" had abandoned William Shockley to create Fairchild Semiconductor in 1957.
                                    Hewlett-Packard's HP Associates division, established around 1960, developed
                                    semiconductor devices primarily for internal use. HP Associates was co-founded by
                                    another former Bell Labs researcher, MOSFET (MOS transistor) inventor Mohamed
                                    Atalla,[13] who served as Director of Semiconductor Research.[14] Instruments and
                                    calculators were some of the products using semiconductor devices from HP
                                    Associates.

                                    During the 1960s, HP partnered with Sony and the Yokogawa Electric companies in
                                    Japan to develop several high-quality products. The products were not a huge
                                    success, as there were high costs in building HP-looking products in Japan. HP and
                                    Yokogawa formed a joint venture (Yokogawa-Hewlett-Packard) in 1963 to market HP
                                    products in Japan.[15] HP bought Yokogawa Electric's share of Hewlett-Packard Japan
                                    in 1999.[16]

                                    HP spun off a small company, Dynac, to specialize in digital equipment. The name was
                                    picked so that the HP logo "hp" could be turned upside down to be a reverse reflect
                                    image of the logo "dy" of the new company. Eventually Dynac changed to Dymec, and
                                    was folded back into HP in 1959.[17] HP experimented with using Digital Equipment
                                    Corporation (DEC) minicomputers with its instruments, but after deciding that it
                                    would be easier to build another small design team than deal with DEC, HP entered
                                    the computer market in 1966 with the HP 2100 / HP 1000 series of minicomputers.
                                    These had a simple accumulator-based design, with two accumulator registers and, in
                                    the HP 1000 models, two index registers. The series was produced for 20 years, in
                                    spite of several attempts to replace it, and was a forerunner of the HP 9800 and HP
                                    250 series of desktop and business computers.

                                    At the end of 1968 cofounder Packard handed over the duties of CEO to Hewlett to
                                    become United States Deputy Secretary of Defense in the incoming Nixon
                                    administration. He resumed the chairmanship in 1972 and served until 1993, but
                                    Hewlett remained CEO.
