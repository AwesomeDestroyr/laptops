                        History of Laptops</h2>
                    <p>1975- The first portable computer was the IBM 5100, released in September 1975. It weighed
                        55-pounds, which was much lighter and more portable than any other computer to date. While not
                        truly a laptop by today's standards, it paved the way for the development of truly portable
                        computers, i.e. laptops.
                        1976- Alan Kay came up with the idea of the laptop computer in 1976 while working at Xerox PARC,
                        calling it the Dynabook. He helped develop a prototype of his Dynabook, which was officially
                        named the Xerox Note Taker.
                        1979- Bill Moggridge designed the GRiD Compass in 1979, the most portable computer at the time
                        and the closest example of a laptop computer. NASA used the GRiD Compass in their space shuttle
                        program in the early 1980s.
                        1981- Developed by Adam Osborne in April 1981, the Osborne I was the first truly portable
                        computer and is recognized as the first true laptop computer. It weighed 24½-pounds and had a 5"
                        display.
                        1981- Epson released the Epson HX-20 in 1981. It was the first portable computer with a built-in
                        printer.
                        1983- Radio Shack released the TRS-80 Model 100 portable computer in the United States in 1983.
                        It featured an LCD, one of the first portable computers with that feature. The TRS-80 Model 100
                        was originally manufactured by Kyocera and sold in Japan, but later the rights were sold to
                        Radio Shack.
                        1984- Commodore released the Commodore SX-64 in 1984, the first portable computer to feature a
                        full-color display screen. It weighed about 20-pounds and sold for $995.
                        1986- IBM released their first laptop, the PC Convertible, in 1986. It weighed 12-pounds, making
                        it the first laptop under 15-pounds.
                        1987- The U.S. Air Force issued an RFP (request for proposal), leading to the purchase of over
                        200,000 laptops. The contract for the manufacturing and purchase of these laptops was awarded to
                        Zenith Data Systems. The Air Force's purchase of such a large number of laptops helped pave the
                        way for the popularity of laptop computers.
                        1987- Hewlett-Packard released the Vectra Portable CS laptop in 1987. It was one of the first
                        laptops to feature a 3 ½" floppy disk drive capable of using 1.44 MB diskettes.
                        1988- Compaq released their first laptop computer in 1988, the Compaq SLT/286. It was the first
                        battery-powered laptop to feature VGA graphics and an internal hard drive.
                        1989- Apple released their first laptop, the Macintosh Portable, in September 1989. Costing
                        $6500
                        at release, it did not sell well and was not a popular laptop.
                        1989- NEC released the NEC UltraLite in 1989, considered to be the first notebook style laptop,
                        weighing less than 5-pounds.
                        1991- After the flop of their Macintosh Portable laptop, Apple re-worked their laptop concept
                        and
                        released the PowerBook line of laptops in October 1991.
                        1992- Microsoft and Intel work together to develop and release APM (advanced power management)
                        specification for laptop computers.
                        1992- Olivetti developed and released the first laptops featuring a touchpad in 1992.
                        1994- Toshiba released the Toshiba Portege 2000 in 2002, the thinnest laptop to be developed at
                        only ¾ of an inch at the thickest part. It also featured the first 1.8-inch hard drive in a
                        laptop.
                        2003- Toshiba releases the Toshiba Portege M100 in 2003, which is the first laptop to feature a
                        slim DVD-ROM drive.
                        2007- ASUS released the Eee PC 701 in October 2007, which was the first netbook to be available.
                        It featured a 7" screen, an Intel Celeron-M processor, and a 4 GB SDHC storage disk.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">
                        The first computer systems used vacuum tubes for circuitry and magnetic drums for memory, and
                        were often enormous, taking up entire rooms. These computers were very expensive to operate and
                        in addition to using a great deal of electricity, the first computers generated a lot of heat,
                        which was often the cause of malfunctions.

                        First generation computers relied on machine language, the lowest-level programming language
                        understood by computers, to perform operations, and they could only solve one problem at a time.
                        It would take operators days or even weeks to set-up a new problem. Input was based on punched
                        cards and paper tape, and output was displayed on printouts.

                        The UNIVAC and ENIAC computers are examples of first-generation computing devices. The UNIVAC
                        was the first commercial computer delivered to a business client, the U.S. Census Bureau in
                        1951.

                    <h2 class="card-title">Second Generation: Transistors (1956-1963)</h2>

                    The world would see transistors replace vacuum tubes in the second generation of
                    computers. The
                    transistor was invented at Bell Labs in 1947 but did not see widespread use in computers
                    until
                    the late 1950s.

                    The transistor was far superior to the vacuum tube, allowing computers to become
                    smaller,
                    faster, cheaper, more energy-efficient and more reliable than their first-generation
                    predecessors. Though the transistor still generated a great deal of heat that subjected
                    the
                    computer to damage, it was a vast improvement over the vacuum tube. Second-generation
                    computers
                    still relied on punched cards for input and printouts for output.

                    From Binary to Assembly
                    Second-generation computers moved from cryptic binary machine language to symbolic, or
                    assembly,
                    languages, which allowed programmers to specify instructions in words. High-level
                    programming
                    languages were also being developed at this time, such as early versions of COBOL and
                    FORTRAN.
                    These were also the first computers that stored their instructions in their memory,
                    which moved
                    from a magnetic drum to magnetic core technology.

                    The first computers of this generation were developed for the atomic energy industry.

                    The development of the integrated circuit was the hallmark of the third generation of
                    computers.
                    Transistors were miniaturized and placed on silicon chips, called semiconductors, which
                    drastically increased the speed and efficiency of computers.

                    Instead of punched cards and printouts, users interacted with third generation computers
                    through
                    keyboards and monitors and interfaced with an operating system, which allowed the device
                    to run
                    many different applications at one time with a central program that monitored the
                    memory.
                    Computers for the first time became accessible to a mass audience because they were
                    smaller and
                    cheaper than their predecessors.

                    Did You Know... ? An integrated circuit (IC) is a small electronic device made out of a
                    semiconductor material. The first integrated circuit was developed in the 1950s by Jack
                    Kilby of
                    Texas Instruments and Robert Noyce of Fairchild Semiconductor.

                    The microprocessor brought the fourth generation of computers, as thousands of
                    integrated
                    circuits were built onto a single silicon chip. What in the first generation filled an
                    entire
                    room could now fit in the palm of the hand. The Intel 4004 chip, developed in 1971,
                    located all
                    the components of the computer—from the central processing unit and memory to
                    input/output
                    controls—on a single chip.

                    In 1981 IBM introduced its first computer for the home user, and in 1984 Apple
                    introduced the
                    Macintosh. Microprocessors also moved out of the realm of desktop computers and into
                    many areas
                    of life as more and more everyday products began to use microprocessors.

                    As these small computers became more powerful, they could be linked together to form
                    networks,
                    which eventually led to the development of the Internet. Fourth generation computers
                    also saw
                    the development of GUIs, the mouse and handheld devices.

                    The Intel 4004 chip

                    Intel's first microprocessor, the 4004, was conceived by Ted Hoff and Stanley Mazor.

                    development,
                    though there are some applications, such as voice recognition, that are being used today.
                    The
                    use of parallel processing and superconductors is helping to make artificial intelligence a
                    reality.

                    Quantum computation and molecular and nanotechnology will radically change the face of
                    computers
                    in years to come. The goal of fifth-generation computing is to develop devices that respond
                    to
                    natural language input and are capable of learning and self-organization.
