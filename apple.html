                                    Apple was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in April 1976 to
                                    develop and
                                    sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer, though Wayne sold his share back within 12
                                    days. It
                                    was incorporated as Apple Computer, Inc., in January 1977, and sales of its
                                    computers, including
                                    the Apple II, grew quickly. Within a few years, Jobs and Wozniak had hired a staff
                                    of computer
                                    designers and had a production line. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial
                                    success.
                                    Over the next few years, Apple shipped new computers featuring innovative graphical

                                    products received widespread critical acclaim. However, the high price of its
                                    products and
                                    limited application library caused problems, as did power struggles between
                                    executives. In 1985,
                                    Wozniak departed Apple amicably and remained an honorary employee, while Jobs and
                                    others
                                    resigned to found NeXT.

                                    As the market for personal computers expanded and evolved through the 1990s, Apple
                                    lost market
                                    share to the lower-priced duopoly of Microsoft Windows on Intel PC clones. The board
                                    recruited
                                    CEO Gil Amelio to what would be a 500-day charge for him to rehabilitate the
                                    financially
                                    troubled companyâ€”reshaping it with layoffs, executive restructuring, and product
                                    focus. In 1997,
                                    he led Apple to buy NeXT, solving the desperately failed operating system strategy
                                    and bringing
                                    Jobs back. Jobs pensively regained leadership status, becoming CEO in 2000. Apple
                                    swiftly
                                    returned to profitability under the revitalizing Think different campaign, as he
                                    rebuilt Apple's
                                    status by launching the iMac in 1998, opening the retail chain of Apple Stores in
                                    2001, and
                                    acquiring numerous companies to broaden the software portfolio. In January 2007,
                                    Jobs renamed
                                    the company Apple Inc., reflecting its shifted focus toward consumer electronics,
                                    and launched
                                    the iPhone to great critical acclaim and financial success. In August 2011, Jobs
                                    resigned as CEO
                                    due to health complications, and Tim Cook became the new CEO. Two months later, Jobs
                                    died,
                                    marking the end of an era for the company. In June 2019, Jony Ive, Apple's CDO, left
                                    the company
                                    to start his own firm, but stated he would work with Apple as its primary client.

                                    Apple is well known for its size and revenues. Its worldwide annual revenue totaled

                                    for the 2018 fiscal year. Apple is the world's largest technology company by revenue
